        Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a tree that grows in tropical regions such as India. The leaf extract is used to reduce tooth plaque and to treat lice.

People use neem for lice, tooth plaque, gingivitis, psoriasis, to repel insects, and for many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using neem for COVID-19. Neem seed oil is used as a pesticide.
