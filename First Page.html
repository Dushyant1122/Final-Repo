    <p> <font color="blue">Water</font> is the single most important resource on the planet that we live on, and that is why it is essential that we conserve it. <font color="blue">Water</font> is the basic necessity for all living beings, and it is incredibly important to conserve it. It is not only important for living and breathing things, but also for many inanimate objects that humans create. For example, to build a house, we need concrete, and to make concrete, we need to mix cement powder with <font color="blue">Water</font>. <font color="blue">Water</font> constitutes more than 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, and yet we do not have enough <font color="blue">Water</font> for our needs. It is essential to conserve and save <font color="blue">Water</font> for ourselves and the entire planet Earth.
        
       
        <p>“<font color="blue">Water</font>,everywhere, but not a drop to drink.” You must have heard this phrase many times in your life. It means that although there is <font color="blue">Water</font> all around us, in Earth’s oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, etc., most of it is not drinkable <font color="blue">Water</font>! The oceans cover up more than 70 percent of all of the Earth’s surface, which is why it is very easy to raise the question – then why do we say that there is a shortage of <font color="blue">Water</font>? It is because the <font color="blue">Water</font>in the oceans is so salty that it is not safe to drink it.</p>
        
        
         
        <p>Thus, we must rely upon the other sources of<font color="blue">Water</font> that the Earth provides us, from the rivers that come from glaciers. However, we must also remember that this <font color="blue">Water</font> is limited, and will exhaust a few decades down the line. Therefore, it is very important to use this <font color="blue">Water</font> responsibly and do everything we can to avoid wasting it. While there is a lot of <font color="blue">Water</font> now, if we keep on using <font color="blue">Water</font> for unnecessary things or wasting it, there won’t be much left around the world.</p>
        
        <p>What if the <font color="blue">Water</font> in the world finishes? Aquatic life such as fish, coral reefs, seahorses, etc. will not be able to survive, because they will lose their habitats. We humans will not survive because our bodies are made up of 70% <font color="blue">Water</font>The Earth, which is a planet characterized by its ability to house life, will not be what it is now.
        </p>
        
         
        <p>There are several ways to save <font color="blue">Water</font>, and they are very easy to inculcate in our daily lives. We must not leave the tap <font color="blue">Water</font> running when we are putting soap while washing our hands. We can use buckets to take a bath rather than use the shower, no flushing of the toilet unnecessarily, always finishing the <font color="blue">Water</font> in our glasses instead of throwing it away, etc. There are many more ways to save <font color="blue">Water</font>, too, but these are just some of them for us to understand the little things that can be done.
        </p>
        <p>It is a common saying that there is power in numbers, which means that if all of us get together and do our small parts in saving <font color="blue">Water</font>, we will surely be able to do so collectively. While individual acts of saving<font color="blue">Water</font> can do little, if all of us waste less <font color="blue">Water</font>, or more judiciously consume <font color="blue">Water</font>, it will all add up to a greater effort.</p>
        
        <p> Thus, <font color="blue">Water</font>’s importance is invaluable in our lives and the lives of all the species that exist on Earth. It is our responsibility to take care of our planet, and saving <font color="blue">Water</font> in any way that we can is one of the best ways to do that. We must always remember that the Earth is our home, and we must always take care of our home and keep it clean and peaceful to live in.</p>
